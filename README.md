# Stock Price Prediction

### RUN IT ON ANY PYTHON DISTRIBUTION

A stock market, equity market or share market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers (a loose network of economic transactions, not a physical facility or discrete entity) of stocks (also called shares), which represent ownership claims on businesses; these may include securities listed on a public stock exchange as well as those only traded privately. Examples of the latter include shares of private companies which are sold to investors through equity crowdfunding platforms. Stock exchanges list shares of common equity as well as other security types, e.g. corporate bonds and convertible bonds. And it will be my attempt to create a model with the help of machine learning algorithm called linear regression to be able to predict the future price of a stock based on its historical data.
